# Moesif Axios Example

This is a simple example with server side Aixos for capturing outgoing APIs call.
This is tested with Node v10 and v11 and v12.

## To run:

Edit index.js and replace "Your Application Id" with your actual Moesif Application id.
Then do below:

```
npm install

node index.js
```

And log into your Moesif account and you should see API data captured.
